Hi, I'm Haocheng Zhu! I am currently a Ph.D. student at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu), working in the [Multisensory Processing Lab](https://shamslab.psych.ucla.edu) under the supervision of [Dr. Ladan Shams](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ws5IamUAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). My research focuses on **human perception**, **computational modeling of cognition**, and **cross-modal integration**. I employ psychophysical experiments and neuroimaging techniques to uncover the general computational principles underlying **multisensory perception**. I am particularly interested in how the brain integrates information from different sensory modalities to create a unified perceptual experience and how these processes can be modeled computationally.

In addition to my research, I am the author of the [BCI Toolbox](https://bcitoolboxrmd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (Bayesian Causal Inference Toolbox), a Python-based statistical and analytical package designed to facilitate Bayesian analysis for multisensory perception and causal inference studies. The toolbox supports researchers in implementing advanced statistical methods for data analysis, enhancing reproducibility and efficiency in research workflows.
